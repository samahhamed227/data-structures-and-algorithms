# Hash Table
A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.

# Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

add Arguments: key, value Returns: nothing This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed. get Arguments: key Returns: Value associated with that key in the table contains Arguments: key Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already. hash Arguments: key Returns: Index in the collection for that key
