## Stack
push onto a stack push multiple values onto a stack pop off the stack empty a stack after multiple pops peek the next item on the stack instantiate an empty stack Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception

## Queue
enqueue into a queue enqueue into a queue enqueue multiple values into a queue dequeue out of a queue the expected value peek into a queue, seeing the expected value empty a queue after multiple dequeues instantiate an empty queue Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
